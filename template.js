const firstName = "Johir"
const LastName = "Kobir"
// this is a old method to write 
const FullName = firstName + " " +LastName + " is an honest boy"

// this is Es6 (new process & effective method)

const FullName2 = `${firstName} ${LastName} is a good chele.`
console.log(FullName2)

// this method is also popular for writing multiline paragraph
const multiline =`this is a new method.
I need to use it in every single paragraph
It is so much user friendly `

console.log(multiline)
